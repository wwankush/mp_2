    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 fish fillets (such as tilapia, cod, or catfish)</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Instructions:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the fish fillets under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Place the fish fillets in a large bowl and pour the buttermilk over them. Let them soak for 15-20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, cornmeal, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper,
            salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat until it reaches
            350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the fish fillets from the buttermilk, allowing the excess to drip off. Dredge each fillet in the
            flour mixture, ensuring an even coat. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
        <li>Carefully add the coated fish fillets to the hot oil. Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
        <li>Fry the fish for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. The internal temperature should
            reach 145°F (63°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the fish from the oil and place it on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the fish hot with lemon wedges on the side. Enjoy your delicious fried fish!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><u>Extra Tips:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For extra crispy fish, double-dip the fillets: after the first coating of the flour mixture, dip them back
            in the buttermilk and then coat them again with the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a spicier kick, increase the amount of cayenne pepper in the flour mixture or add a dash of
            hot sauce to the buttermilk soak.</li>
        <li>Maintain the oil temperature by using a thermometer. If the oil is too hot, the fish will burn before
            cooking through; if it's too cool, the fish will be greasy.</li>
        <li>Serve with tartar sauce, coleslaw, or fries for a complete meal.</li>
        <li>Leftover fried fish can be reheated in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10-15 minutes to maintain its
            crispiness.</li>
    </ul>
