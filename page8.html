    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Instructions:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and pour the buttermilk over them. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, mix together the flour, cornmeal, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing the excess to drip off. Dredge each piece in the seasoned flour mixture, ensuring an even coat. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Carefully add the chicken pieces to the hot oil in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken for 3-5 minutes, turning occasionally, until it is golden brown and crispy. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the oil and place it on a wire rack set over a baking sheet to drain excess oil. Let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce and enjoy your delicious chicken popcorn!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><u>Extra Tips:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For extra flavor, add a teaspoon of your favorite seasoning blend to the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a spicier kick, increase the amount of cayenne pepper or add a dash of hot sauce to the buttermilk marinade.</li>
        <li>Make sure the oil temperature stays consistent. Too low, and the chicken will be greasy; too high, and it will burn before cooking through.</li>
        <li>Use a thermometer to check the oil temperature and the internal temperature of the chicken for the best results.</li>
        <li>Leftover chicken popcorn can be reheated in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 10-15 minutes to maintain its crispiness.</li>
    </ul>
