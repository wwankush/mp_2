    <h3><u>Recipe Steps:</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Noodles:</strong> Boil water in a pot and cook the chowmein noodles according to the
            package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar.
            Set aside.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Stir-Fry Vegetables:</strong> Heat cooking oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the
            sliced onion and minced garlic. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Add Vegetables:</strong> Add the sliced bell pepper, julienned carrot, and thinly sliced cabbage to
            the pan. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Add Noodles and Sauce:</strong> Add the cooked noodles to the pan with the stir-fried vegetables.
            Pour the prepared sauce over the noodles and vegetables. Toss everything together until well combined. Cook
            for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Season and Garnish:</strong> Season the chowmein with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, garnish
            with sliced green onions for added freshness.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Transfer the chowmein to serving plates or bowls. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        <br>
    </ol>

    <h3><u>Extra Tips:</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prep Ingredients in Advance:</strong> Chop all your vegetables and prepare the sauce before you
            start cooking.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Use High Heat:</strong> Stir-frying works best with high heat, so make sure your pan or wok is hot
            before adding the ingredients.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Don't Overcook the Vegetables:</strong> Aim to stir-fry the vegetables until they are tender-crisp.
        </li> <br>
        <li><strong>Cook Noodles Al Dente:</strong> Be careful not to overcook the noodles when boiling them.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Toss Frequently:</strong> Keep the ingredients moving in the pan or wok by tossing them frequently
            with a spatula or pair of tongs.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Adjust Seasonings to Taste:</strong> Taste the chowmein before serving and adjust the seasonings as
            needed.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Experiment with Add-Ins:</strong> Feel free to add your favorite proteins and additional vegetables
            to customize the dish.</li> <br>
        <li><strong>Serve Immediately:</strong> Chowmein is best served hot and fresh from the pan.</li> <br>
    </ul>
