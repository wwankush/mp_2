    <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds and chopped green onions for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Instructions;</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Rinse the chicken wings under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, honey, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, garlic powder, ginger powder, black pepper, and red pepper flakes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chicken wings to the bowl and toss them until they are well coated with the marinade.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the wings marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top. Arrange the marinated wings on the wire rack.</li>
        <li>Bake the wings in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, flipping them halfway through, until they are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove the wings from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><u>Extra Tips:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For extra crispy wings, broil them for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking.</li>
        <li>If you prefer spicier wings, increase the amount of red pepper flakes or add a dash of hot sauce to the marinade.</li>
        <li>To ensure even cooking, make sure the wings are spread out in a single layer on the wire rack.</li>
        <li>Serve with a side of ranch or blue cheese dressing for dipping.</li>
        <li>You can also grill the wings instead of baking them for a smoky flavor.</li>
    </ul>
