    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>4 burger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices of cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Tomato slices</li>
        <li>Pickle slices</li>
        <li>Onion slices</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Instructions:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill or skillet to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix gently until just combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each portion into a patty about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>
            Place the patties on the preheated grill or skillet. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. If using cheese, add a slice to each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover to melt.
        </li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or skillet until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Assemble the burgers by spreading mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard on the bottom half of each bun.</li>
        <li>Place the cooked patties on the buns, then top with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onions.</li>
        <li>Cover with the top half of the buns and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious homemade burgers!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><u>Extra Tips:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For juicier burgers, avoid over-mixing the ground beef. Mix just until the seasonings are incorporated.</li>
        <li>Let the patties rest for a few minutes after shaping them. This helps them hold their shape better during cooking.</li>
        <li>If you prefer a smoky flavor, add a dash of liquid smoke to the ground beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Experiment with different types of cheese, such as cheddar, Swiss, or blue cheese, to find your favorite combination.</li>
        <li>Serve the burgers with a side of fries or a fresh salad for a complete meal.</li>
    </ul>
