    <h2><u>Instructions:</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Separate the drumette and wingette portions of the chicken wings.</li>
                <li>For each drumette, push the meat towards one end to create a lollipop shape.</li>
                <li>For each wingette, cut along one end, push the meat towards the other end, and remove the smaller
                    bone, leaving the larger bone with the meat pushed down.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, chili sauce, vinegar, ginger-garlic paste, black pepper powder,
                    and salt.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken lollipops to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated. Marinate for at least 30
                    minutes (or up to 2 hours for better flavor).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In another bowl, mix all-purpose flour, cornstarch, egg, ginger-garlic paste, soy sauce, chili
                    sauce, black pepper powder, and salt.</li>
                <li>Add water gradually to make a smooth, thick batter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Coat and Fry the Chicken:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Dip each marinated chicken lollipop into the batter, ensuring an even coat.</li>
                <li>Carefully drop the coated chicken lollipops into the hot oil.</li>
                <li>Fry in batches until golden brown and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add finely chopped garlic and ginger, sauté until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add finely chopped spring onions and sauté for another minute.</li>
                <li>Stir in soy sauce, chili sauce, tomato ketchup, vinegar, and sugar. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Add water and bring the sauce to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Stir in the cornstarch slurry and cook until the sauce thickens. Adjust seasoning with salt if
                    needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Combine and Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the fried chicken lollipops to the sauce, tossing to coat them evenly.</li>
                <li>Serve hot, garnished with chopped spring onions or cilantro.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2><u>Extra Tips:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uniform Size:</strong> Try to cut the chicken wings into uniform sizes to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper Marination:</strong> Allow enough time for marination (at least 30 minutes, preferably 2
            hours) to let the flavors penetrate the meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Batter Consistency:</strong> Ensure the batter is not too thick or too runny. It should be able to
            coat the chicken lollipops evenly without dripping too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil Temperature:</strong> Maintain a consistent oil temperature (around 350°F or 175°C) while
            frying. Too hot, and the exterior will burn before the inside cooks; too cool, and the lollipops will absorb
            too much oil and become greasy.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Frying (Optional):</strong> For extra crispiness, you can fry the lollipops twice. First, fry
            them until they are just cooked, then remove and let them cool slightly. Fry them again until golden brown
            and crispy.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain Well:</strong> After frying, place the chicken lollipops on a wire rack or paper towels to
            drain excess oil. This helps maintain their crispiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce Consistency:</strong> If you prefer a thicker sauce, increase the amount of cornstarch in the
            slurry. For a thinner sauce, reduce the cornstarch or add a bit more water.</li>
        <li><strong>Spice Level:</strong> Adjust the amount of chili sauce and black pepper according to your spice
            preference. You can also add finely chopped green chilies for an extra kick.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Ingredients:</strong> Use fresh ginger, garlic, and spring onions for a more vibrant and
            flavorful sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Serving:</strong> Serve the chicken lollipops immediately after tossing them in the sauce to retain
            their crispiness. They can be served as an appetizer or a main course.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnishing:</strong> Garnish with chopped spring onions, cilantro, or sesame seeds for an added
            touch of flavor and presentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Variation:</strong> For a healthier version, you can bake the chicken lollipops in the oven
            at 400°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes, turning them halfway through, until they are cooked through and
            crispy.</li>
    </ul>
